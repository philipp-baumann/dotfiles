# dotfiles

dotfiles that reside in my homes (yes my computation engines live in
several homes with friendly hosts):

  - on CentOS 7 on a 48 core VM with 1TB RAM, part of Big Lebowski and
    owned by ETH ZÃ¼rich
  - on local Ubuntu 18 running on a hackintosh Pro, provided by ETH and
    in control of me
