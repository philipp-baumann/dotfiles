dotfiles that reside in my homes (yes my computation engines live in several homes with friendly hosts):

- on CentOS 7 on a 48 core VM with 1TB RAM, part of Big Lebowski and owned by ETH ZÃ¼rich
- on local Ubuntu 18 running on a hackintosh Pro, provided by ETH and in control of me

I am the same on both machines:

```{bash}
whoami
```

```{bash}
# This is my remote friend with blue fishes and cabal;
# cooking with elixir comes later
ls -la /media/vm/
```
